# Advent of Code in Ruby

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code problems. All solutions
are implemented in Ruby.

To run a solution use the `bin/run` script created for that purpose. For example
to run the solution for part 2 of day 2 of 2021 you would do:

```bash
$ bin/run solve 2021/02 2
```
